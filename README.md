================

I believe in having as few bash functions, aliases, etc. as possible. Others do not agree, so they won't find this useful. At one point my system was configured with the Hashrocket [dotmatrix](https://github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix) but I've since whittled it away until there's nothing left. There were too many functions and aliases in that config.

Some of the layout of this repo is inspired by [Zach Holman's excellent dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) repo, even though I don't use any of his actual config. You can read about why having a good set of dotfiles is important on Zach's blog.

Organization
------------

Inside `bash/` is a my bash config scripts.
 * `.bashrc` is initially loaded
 * `.bashrc.alias` is a set of aliases that I care about.
 * `.bashrc.local` is for local system config
